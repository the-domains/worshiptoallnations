Vision: To provide top-notch worship leader education FREE of charge to potential worship leaders. 

This idea was originally born by a desire to help missionaries and Christians in far-away places, such as a village in Mongolia. I envision a young worshipper, with a passion for music, but lacking the tools to impact her surroundings. I wanted to provide her, and thousands of others like her, with concrete, practical, and useful tools to be talented, professional, and passionate worship leaders. That's when I realized, that it's not only missionaries that could benefit from learning how to become better worshippers. Churches all over the worst could benefit from this charity. That's why worship to all nations courses are FREE to the public.
